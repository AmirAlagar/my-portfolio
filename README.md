## My Portfolio

This is my portfolio made in Laravel and Bootstrap. For the mean time, I made it static. I will continue to update this as much as possible. I'm planning to transform it to a CMS in the future.

## My GitHub and previous Projects

This is a new GitHub account.
I was planning to add the first two projects(both made in Laravel) I was part of in this portfolio but the email I used to create an account(GitLab) was from the company I was previously employed.
